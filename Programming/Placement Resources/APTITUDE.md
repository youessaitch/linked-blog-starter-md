- **GCD (a, b) = (a × b)/ LCM (a, b)**.
- ### No of days taken wale problem me :
	- [x/A + x/B]*t = x --> A = days taken by A alone, B = days taken by B alone 
	- Isse almost sare questions solve ho jate, 3 log ho to increase the variables accordingly
- #### Area: [2D]
	- Rhombus = 0.5 X product of diagonals
	- Triangle =  sqrt(s(s–a)(s–b)(s–c)s(s–a)(s–b)(s–c)) where s= (a+b+c)/2
	- Trapezium = 0.5 x Sum of parallel sides x Perpendicular Height
- #### Volume: [3D]
	- Cuboid = L X B X H
	- Cube = a^3   , Length of Diagonal = √3 a
	- Cylinder : Volume = π R^2 H , Curved Surface Area = 2 π R H, Total Surface are = 2 π R H + 2 π R^2
	- Cone : Volume = π R^2 H /3 , CSR = π R L {where L = √(H^2 + R^2)}
	- Sphere : Volume = (4/3)πR^3 , Area = 4 π R^2
	- Hemisphere = Half of sphere
