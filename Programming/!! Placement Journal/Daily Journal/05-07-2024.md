# NOTE ✍️
- Kaafi jyada stressed the subah tk, then figured out some ways. Dont worry, kuch nhi hoga. So chill. Agar hot av hai to dekh lenge. Look at Rohit kitna chill rehta, no stress of future bs jo mann me ata krta (obv future ko dhyan me rkhte hue) but stressfull manner me nhi. bachpan se apan sath hi rhe hai but circumstances made him the way he is. I also play the punctual and ideal way isiliye thoda sa punctuality se divert hota to darr lgne lgta.
- BRUH aise life me aage kya krenge. Agr startup krna ho to job chodne se v darte rhenge???
- Rohit to mst decide kr liya hai ki kuch mahine se chorna hai kyuki UPSC krna hai, ofc he's motivated and so should I. Look at Abhijeet Anand, rohit ka dost 6lpa core job phir v mst chill hai. Aur padhai kr rha kisi competition k liye, agr wo v aise haar maan leta to kya krta.
- ## Everything in life is an illusion, once you're on ur death bed nothing would ever matter. Jo cheeze aaj itni darawani lg rhi, kl nhi lagegi aur kabhi lagni v nhi chaiye. Life is not just a path that I need to follow agar deviate krte to sb khtm.
- ### Its not how it is. Life is complex and so are people and so am I. So just enjoy the life. There's not only one path to reach financial freedom. I'll figure something out eventually. 
- ## I'm an IITian ofc and a very hard working guy.

- # Hard work is useful for those who dont believe in themself
