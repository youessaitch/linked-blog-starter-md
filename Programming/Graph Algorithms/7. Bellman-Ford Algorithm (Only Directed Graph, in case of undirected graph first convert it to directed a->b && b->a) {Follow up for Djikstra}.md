- ## Disadvantages of Djikstra:
	1. ==Do not work on negative edges== (bcuz visited genrally use krte nhi bs jo v chota edge hota waha chala jata to negative edge me infinite times run hota reh jayega)
	2. Wont detect negative cycle (net wt sum = -ve, then the cycle se called negative cycle)

## Advantages of Bellman Ford
	1. Can work for negative edges
	2. Can detect Negative Cycle


### So, the need for Bellman Ford
- ==Given V vertices of a graph, if you relax all vertices by V-1 times, you'll get the shortest path==

This is what it means by relaxation ^^^^. updating values smaller every time

- Why V-1?
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/WI1VNyV.png)
	- The ans will be updated during V-1 time iterations and after that no change can be done bcuz src will be initialized to 0 and then we'll have to update V-1 node distances only

### Negative cycle detection

### ==NOTE : DO not use priority_queue here bcuz we want to perform the V-1 operations in same order we followed in the first iteration but if we use pq, then order may change==

### Code:
```cpp
/*  Function to implement Bellman Ford
    *   edges: vector of vectors which represents the graph
    *   S: source vertex to start traversing graph with
    *   V: number of vertices
    */
    vector<int> bellman_ford(int V, vector<vector<int>>& edges, int S) {
        // Code here
        vector<int> ans(V,1e8);
        ans[S]=0;
        
        //V-1 relaxation
        for(int i=1;i<=V-1;i++){
            
            for(auto it: edges){
                int u = it[0];
                int v = it[1];
                int wt = it[2];
                
                if(ans[u] !=1e8 && ans[u] + wt < ans[v]){
                    ans[v] = ans[u]+wt;
                }
            }
        }
        
        //Now Detect -ve cycle (Do the operation one more time only)
        for(auto it: edges){
            int u = it[0];
            int v = it[1];
            int wt = it[2];
                
            if(ans[u] !=1e8 && ans[u] + wt < ans[v]){
                return {-1}; //if 1 more operation can be done then -ve cycle
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
```

### Time Complexity: Bellman = O(E*V)
### Time Complexity: Djikstra = O(ElogV)
### So, Djikstra better in terms of time complexity
