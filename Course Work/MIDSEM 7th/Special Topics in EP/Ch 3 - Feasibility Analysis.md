- Feasibility analysis is the process of determining if a business idea is viable before proceeding with a business plan. It involves four key steps: recognizing a business idea, testing its feasibility, writing a business plan, and launching the business. A feasibility analysis focuses on assessing the potential of the entire business, not just the product or service. Entrepreneurs often skip this step, which can lead to failure by overlooking inherent risks.

	John W. Mullins emphasizes that without proper investigation, entrepreneurs may become overly optimistic, leading to flawed business plans. A feasibility analysis comprises four key areas: product/service feasibility, industry/market feasibility, organizational feasibility, and financial feasibility. It involves both ==primary research== (e.g., talking to experts and prospective customers) and ==secondary research== (e.g., using existing data and industry studies). 
	
	The purpose of feasibility analysis is to rigorously test and refine a business idea before launching it.

Overall Assessment

## 1. Product/Service Feasibility Analysis
- Product/service feasibility analysis evaluates the appeal and viability of a proposed product or service. It focuses on two main components: **desirability** and **demand**.

1. **Product/Service Desirability**: This assesses whether the product or service makes sense, fills a market gap, and is well-timed for introduction. Entrepreneurs should gather feedback from prospective customers and industry experts via ==concept tests==. These tests present a one-page description of the product, target market, benefits, competitor positioning, and management team to gather informed opinions and identify potential issues.
	- Note: Concept Test A concept test involves showing a preliminary description of a product or service idea, called a concept statement, to industry experts and prospective customers to solicit their feedback. It is a one-page document. 
		After the concept statement is developed, it should be shown to at least
		10 people who are familiar with the industry that the firm plans to enter and who
		can provide informed feedback.
    
2. **Product/Service Demand**: Demand is assessed through surveys and research. A ==**buying intentions survey**== helps gauge customer interest, though responses may be optimistic. Additionally, ==**library, Internet, and gumshoe research**== (informal detective-like investigation) are used to gather further insights on market demand. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to consult trade associations, attend ==trade shows==, and observe consumer behavior to refine their ideas.
	- A **buying intentions survey** is designed to gauge potential customer interest in a product or service by presenting them with a concept statement and asking them to respond to a series of questions. The survey should be distributed to 20-30 potential customers.

The goal is to ensure the product/service will appeal to and be purchased by its target market.


## 2. Industry/Target Market Feasibility Analysis
- **Industry/Target Market Feasibility Analysis** involves evaluating the overall appeal of an industry and the target market for a proposed product or service. It has two key components: **industry attractiveness** and **target market attractiveness**.

	### 1. **Industry Attractiveness**
	An attractive industry typically has the following characteristics:
	- **Young and early in its life cycle** (more receptive to new entrants).
	- **Fragmented, not concentrated** (no dominant players).
	- **Growing rather than shrinking**.
	- Selling products or services that customers "must have" rather than "want to have."
	- **Not overcrowded**, with high operating margins.
	- **Not dependent** on the low price of a key raw material.
	
	Start-ups thrive in industries with fewer barriers to entry and favorable trends (economic, societal, technological) that enhance the long-term viability of the industry.

	### 2. **Target Market Attractiveness**
	A target market represents a narrower group of customers within a broader market. Start-ups typically focus on a **small target market** to avoid competing with industry leaders and better serve a niche. For example, Sprig Toys targets parents willing to pay for eco-friendly, educational toys. 
	
	Assessing target market attractiveness is challenging because it may involve pioneering a new niche. ==Key to success is identifying a market large enough to sustain the business but small enough to avoid attracting larger competitors.==
	
	**Tommy John**, a men's undershirt maker, illustrates this by carving out a niche within the broader $30 billion men's undershirt market with its "Second Skin" line. The company remains focused on this target market rather than expanding too quickly.
	
	To assess both industry and target market attractiveness, research sources such as industry reports and databases (e.g., IBISWorld, Mintel) are useful, but synthesizing data from multiple industries and markets may be necessary when pioneering a new niche market.


## 3. Organizational Feasibility Analysis
- **Organizational Feasibility Analysis** assesses whether a business has the necessary management expertise, organizational competence, and resources to succeed. It focuses on two primary areas: **management prowess** and **resource sufficiency**.

	### 1. **Management Prowess**
	This evaluates the abilities of the founding team or solo entrepreneur. Key factors include:
	- **Passion** for the business idea.
	- **Understanding** of the target markets.
	- **Professional and social networks**, which provide access to expertise and support.
	- The ability to assemble a capable **new-venture team** (founders, key employees, advisers).
	- Having potential partners or board members identified to enhance management capability.
	- Note: One thing that many potential business founders find while assessing management prowess is that they may benefit from finding one or more partners to help them launch their business.
	
	### 2. **Resource Sufficiency**
	This examines whether the venture can access **nonfinancial resources** essential for success, such as:
	- Skilled employees or specialists.
	- Intellectual property protection (like patents), especially for innovative products or processes.
	- Availability of the 6 to 12 critical nonfinancial resources required to move the business forward.

	- To assess organizational feasibility, a business must evaluate whether it has the necessary **nonfinancial resources** to move forward. Critical resources often include:
	
		- **Affordable office and operational space**
		- **Access to contract manufacturers or service providers**
		- **Key management and support personnel**, both for the present and future
		- **Essential equipment** (computers, machinery, delivery vehicles)
		- **Intellectual property protection**
		- **Support from local or state governments**, if applicable
		- **Favorable business partnerships**
	
	Ensuring these resources are available is key for start-up success.
	
	The analysis ensures the business has both the leadership and resources to effectively launch and operate.


## 4. Financial Feasibility Analysis
- **Financial feasibility analysis** is the final part of assessing a new business idea, focusing on:

	1. **Total Start-Up Cash Needed**: This includes capital purchases and operating expenses required to get the business operational and make its first sale. A detailed budget should outline where the initial funds will come from, and overestimating costs is recommended to account for unexpected expenses.
	
	2. **Financial Performance of Similar Businesses**: By comparing the proposed venture to similar businesses, entrepreneurs can estimate potential financial performance. Resources like IBISWorld, BizMiner, and BizStats.com can provide financial data for comparable firms.
	
	3. **Overall Financial Attractiveness**: Evaluating financial attractiveness involves considering projected sales, profitability, and rate of return. Start-up projections should be weighed against the capital invested, risks, and potential alternatives for both the money and the entrepreneur's time and effort.
	
	The goal of this analysis is to determine if the business has strong financial potential before moving forward with more detailed projections.

#### Note: First Screen - A feasibility analysis template

- **First Screen** is a template used for conducting a feasibility analysis of a business idea, serving as an initial assessment before moving to a full business plan. It covers the four key areas of feasibility: product/service, industry/market, organizational, and financial feasibility. The worksheet highlights important points in each area and allows for suggested revisions to improve the business idea's potential.

	For example, if "Initial Capital Investment" and "Time to Break Even" are rated as low potential, the founders might suggest outsourcing or contract manufacturing as alternatives. These changes can transform low-potential areas into high-potential ones. 
	
	The **First Screen** helps identify potential issues early on, encouraging flexibility and adjustments. It is a brief, fact-based analysis designed to gauge the overall feasibility of a business idea. Several versions of the worksheet can be completed, allowing for refinement and iteration before committing to a business plan.
