- Industry : Group of firms

### Industry Analysis
- Industry analysis involves evaluating the attractiveness and opportunities within an industry before starting a new venture. Entrepreneurs must answer three key questions: 

1. **Accessibility**: Is the industry realistic for a new firm to enter?
2. **Innovation potential**: Are there markets ripe for innovation or underserved?
3. **Positioning**: Are there favorable positions within the industry that avoid negative attributes?

Understanding the competitive landscape is crucial, as it helps firms identify opportunities and threats. Some industries are more attractive due to higher growth rates or favorable conditions. For example, the e-book publishing industry is expected to grow faster than traditional book publishing, which makes it more favorable for new ventures.

Entrepreneurs can assess industry attractiveness by studying two key types of **trends**:

1. **Environmental Trends**: **PEST** Economic, social, technological, and political changes significantly impact industry strength. For example, industries serving seniors benefit from an aging population, while those selling sugary products face challenges due to health trends.
2. **Business Trends**: Factors like outsourcing and the ability to move operations online can benefit some industries, providing cost advantages.

Staying informed about trends through industry trade associations, trade shows, and journals is important for maintaining a competitive edge in the chosen industry.

### Five Forces Model

- the framework is comprised of the forces that determine industry profitability.
- Each of Porter’s five forces affects the average rate of return for the firms in an industry by applying pressure on industry profitability. Well-managed companies try to position their firms in a way that avoids or diminishes these forces—in an attempt to beat the average rate of return for the industry.

#### 1. Threat of Substitutes
- The threat of substitutes refers to the risk that products or services from other industries can replace those in a firm's industry, impacting profitability. Industries are more attractive when the threat of substitutes is low. For instance, ==the pharmaceutical industry faces little substitution, making it highly profitable.== However, when substitutes exist, like videoconferencing replacing air travel, consumers may opt for alternatives, especially if substitutes are free or low-cost. ==Companies often provide added value or amenities to reduce customer switching.== Starbucks, for example, offers a high-quality experience to prevent customers from opting for cheaper coffee alternatives, though economic slowdowns may affect this strategy.


#### 2. Threat of New Entrants
- The threat of new entrants in an industry affects its attractiveness, with industries being more appealing when ==entry barriers are high.== Barriers to entry make it difficult for new competitors to enter and replicate what incumbents are doing. Major sources of entry barriers include:

	1. **Economies of scale**: ==Large-scale production reduces costs,== making it hard for new entrants to compete without a cost disadvantage.
	2. **Product differentiation**: Strong brands or continuous innovation deter new competitors.
	3. **Capital requirements**: ==High initial investments==, such as in the automobile industry, can prevent new entrants.
	4. **Cost advantages independent of size**: Established firms may have historical cost advantages, like owning land or equipment at lower prices.
	5. **Access to distribution channels**: Crowded markets can make it difficult for new products to gain shelf space.
	6. **Government and legal barriers**: Patents, trademarks, and regulations in industries like biotechnology create obstacles.
	
	Start-ups often create nontraditional barriers, like patents, trade secrets, or world-class management teams, to protect their market position and discourage new entrants.
	- Start-ups creating new industries or niche markets must establish their own barriers to entry to protect against competition, but they often lack the resources to create expensive barriers like economies of scale. The main risk is that larger, better-funded companies will copy their innovations. The best protection is intellectual property—patents, trademarks, or copyrights—which legally prevent competitors from duplicating their products or services. These protections are ideal for maintaining a competitive edge.

#### 3. Rivalry Among Existing Firms
- The ==intensity of rivalry among existing firms== is a key factor in determining industry profitability. Some industries, like airlines, are highly competitive, leading to price wars and lower profits, while others, like specialized medical equipment, are less competitive with higher margins.

	Four primary factors affect the nature and intensity of competition:
	1. **Number and balance of competitors**: More firms and equally sized competitors can lead to ==price-cutting==, which destabilizes the industry.
	2. **Degree of product differentiation**: Industries with undifferentiated products, like paper, tend to compete on price, while industries with unique products experience less price competition.
	3. **Growth rate of the industry**: ==Slow-growing industries, such as insurance, tend to have more intense competition,== while fast-growing industries, like e-book publishing, have less pressure to cut prices.
	4. **Level of fixed costs**: Industries with high fixed costs, like manufacturing, are driven to sell more to cover their costs, leading to increased competition and possible price-cutting.

#### 4. Bargaining Power of Suppliers
- Industries are ==more attractive== when the bargaining power of suppliers is ==low==, as powerful suppliers can suppress profitability by raising prices or reducing the quality of their products. Key factors influencing supplier power include:

	1. **Supplier concentration**: Fewer suppliers for a critical product give those suppliers more power, as seen in the pharmaceutical industry.
	2. **Switching costs**: High switching costs discourage buyers from changing suppliers, as they may face significant time and effort to adapt to a new supplier.
	3. **Attractiveness of substitutes**: Supplier power increases when there are no viable alternatives, like Intel and Microsoft's dominance in the PC industry.
	4. **Threat of forward integration**: Suppliers gain more power if they could potentially enter the buyer's industry, as with Microsoft’s potential to produce PCs.
	
	These factors allow suppliers to influence pricing and profitability in the industries they serve.


#### 5. Bargaining Power of Buyers
- Industries are more attractive when the bargaining power of buyers is low, as buyers can reduce profitability by demanding price cuts or improved quality. Several factors influence buyers' bargaining power:

	1. **Buyer group concentration**: When a few large buyers purchase from many suppliers, they can pressure suppliers to lower prices.
	2. **Buyer’s costs**: Buyers become more price-sensitive if a supplier’s product represents a significant portion of their production costs.
	3. **Degree of product standardization**: Buyers can leverage lower prices if a supplier’s product is undifferentiated and easily comparable to others.
	4. **Threat of backward integration**: Buyers gain power if they can credibly threaten to enter the supplier’s industry, like PC manufacturers potentially producing their own monitors.
	
	These factors allow buyers to exert pressure on suppliers and influence pricing and profitability.
