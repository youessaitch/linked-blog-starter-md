How was the day Warrior?
- [ ] 😋 very
- [x] 🙂 okay
- [ ] 😒 gotta do more
- [ ] 😩 hell naa

# NOTE ✍️
- Good day, solved 10+ Problems.
- But got demotivated due to the intern thing. I get stressed very easily and it affects my work. 
- ## Stress lekr kya hi hoga, jo hona hai wo hoga always try to look for ki aage kya kr skte. Stressing costs me around 1-2 hr a day jisme kuch acha kr skte.
- # Dont ask others for answer during a contest. Worst thing ever, ek ques janne k baad dusra khud se krne ka mann nhi hota + question dusre se puchkr contest time 2 hr ka time waste hai. Kuch fayda nhi hua un 2 ghanto ka #habit 
- Baki to gym nhi gye, aur project v nhi kiye, kl krna padega. Vibhash k dost se baat krke acha laga. Good guidance, dude did not have an intern either pr kitne ache se utilise kra time ko. Its just a setback. Grind harder.
- Aaj k liye itna hi, although ek intern abhi v mil jaye to acha hi hai, anyways lets work to make a good cv.
