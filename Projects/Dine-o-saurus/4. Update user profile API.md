- JSX, TSX codes gets converted to JS file while build. Typescript and stuffs are made for us to do things easily, during deployment it gets converted into JS file. Check the /dist folder in backend once, made using npm run build
- ### Make a repository on github for backend
	- Add the backend file to repository using vs code, make a .gitignore file and add the name of files you want to ignore, mainly .env files etc (dist/ -> can be installed using npm run build , and node_modules folder-> can be installed using npm install)
	- To change from master branch to main branch -> `git branch -M main`
	- DEPLOY THE BACKEND ON render.com
- ### Similarly do for frontend
