- A business model is a firm’s plan or diagram for how it competes, uses its resources, structures its relationships, interfaces with customers, and creates value to sustain itself on the basis of the profits it earns.


## Business Models and their Importance
- A firm's business model outlines its strategy for creating, delivering, and capturing value for stakeholders. It represents the core elements of a business and illustrates how these elements work together. Three crucial aspects of a business model are the target market, the basis for differentiation, and key assets. Using the example of Her Campus, its target market is college-aged females, its differentiation is a focus on topics relevant to that group (style, beauty, health, etc.), and its key assets are its network of 4,000+ volunteers writing content. The interconnectedness of these elements makes the business model effective and hard to replicate. 

	Key stages include:
	1. Initial validation of the business idea.
	2. Preparation of the business model.
	3. Fleshing out operational details.

## General Categories of Business Models
- There are two general categories of business models: **standard business models** and **disruptive business models**.

	### 1. **Standard Business Models**  
	Standard business models are widely used by both established firms and new ventures. These models are existing frameworks that help firms determine how to create, deliver, and capture value. For example, Amazon adopted the mail-order business model and moved it online, while Birchbox built on the subscription model by offering cosmetic samples. Each standard model has strengths and weaknesses. The subscription model, for instance, generates recurring revenue but faces churn, or customer loss.
	- Note: ==Churn== refers to the number of subscribers that a subscription-based business ==loses each month.==
	
	**Examples of Standard Business Models**:
	- **Advertising Model**: Selling ad space to targeted audiences (e.g., Google, Facebook).
	- **Auction Model**: A platform for auction sales (e.g., eBay).
	- **Bricks and Clicks**: Combining online and offline operations (e.g., Apple, Barnes & Noble).
	- **Franchise Model**: Licensing a business’s brand and operations (e.g., Panera Bread, 24 Hour Fitness).
	- **Freemium Model**: Offering basic services for free and charging for premium versions (e.g., Dropbox, Pandora).
	- **Low-Cost Model**: Minimizing costs to service large customer bases (e.g., Southwest Airlines, Warby Parker).
	- **Peer-to-Peer Model**: Connecting individuals offering services with those seeking them (e.g., Airbnb, TaskRabbit).
	- **Razor and Blades Model**: Selling a primary product at a discount and complementary products at a higher margin (e.g., game consoles and games).
	- **Subscription Model**: Offering services for recurring fees (e.g., Netflix, Birchbox).
	
	### 2. **Disruptive Business Models**  
	These models are less common and tend to challenge or transform existing industries by offering something innovative that disrupts the traditional way of doing business.

	**Disruptive business models** are rare and differ from standard models by significantly changing how business is conducted in an industry. They often create new markets or address unmet needs in existing ones.
	
	### Types of Disruptive Business Models:
	
	1. **New Market Disruption**: Targets previously underserved(people with less access to resources) markets, creating new opportunities. An example is Google AdWords, which made online advertising accessible and affordable for small businesses, unlike previous expensive options.
	
	2. **Low-End Market Disruption**: Focuses on offering simpler, lower-cost alternatives to existing products or services that have become over-engineered. Examples include:
	   - **Southwest Airlines**: Offering low-cost, no-frills flights, appealing to customers willing to trade amenities for lower fares.
	   - **Uber**: Revolutionized the taxi industry by providing a cheaper, app-based alternative with high convenience and quality standards.
	
	Disruptive models succeed by offering compelling, convenient, and cost-effective alternatives that appeal to underserved or dissatisfied customers.
	
	New businesses must still evaluate the strength of opportunities and validate ideas before choosing a business model, as no single model guarantees success. For instance, while the peer-to-peer model has been successful with companies like Airbnb, it doesn't ensure success without careful planning and execution.

## The barringer/ireland business Model template

- The Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template is a comprehensive tool that helps entrepreneurs design a business model by breaking it down into four major categories and twelve parts. It allows for clear visualization of a firm's core strategy, making it adaptable as ideas evolve. The template's four core categories are:
- #### 1. Core Strategy:
	- The **mission** defines why the business exists and its long-term goals, while the **basis of differentiation** explains how a company's products stand out from competitors. The **target market** is a narrow group of customers the business will focus on, and the **product/market scope** outlines the initial product offerings and the markets the business will serve, with plans for future growth.
	- **1. Business Mission** : A well-written mission statement explains the firm's purpose, what makes it unique, and guides decision-making. It should be challenging, aligned with the company’s values, and honest.
	- **2. Basis of Differentiation**: This defines what sets a company's product apart. ==Differentiation should focus on benefits rather than just features.== For example, ZUCA, a backpack on rollers, differentiates by solving back pain issues while being sturdy enough to sit on.
	- **3. Target Market**: It's essential to clearly define the target market. Most businesses focus on an underserved niche rather than broad markets. For instance, Birchbox targeted women excited to try new things, which shaped its overall business strategy.
	- **4. Product/Market Scope**: This defines the products and markets the business will initially focus on. ==Most companies start narrow and expand over time==, like Dropbox, which initially focused on tech-savvy users in Silicon Valley and gradually expanded its product line and market base.

- #### 2. Resources
	- The second component of the Barringer/Ireland Business Model Template is **resources**, which are the inputs a firm uses to produce and deliver its products or services. For a business model to be competitive, its resources must be ==both hard to imitate== and ==difficult to substitute.==

	1. **Core Competencies**: These are the firm’s unique capabilities that give it a competitive edge and set it apart from its rivals, such as technical know-how, customer relationships, or product expertise. For example, Netflix’s core competency in supply chain management was crucial for its DVD delivery model. Start-ups typically list 2-3 core competencies, which should be essential, hard to replicate, and difficult to replace.
	
	2. **Key Assets**: These are the critical resources that make the business model work. They can be **physical** (e.g., equipment, vehicles), **intellectual** (e.g., patents, trademarks), **financial** (e.g., cash, credit lines), or **human** (e.g., founders, key employees). For instance, Uber relies on intellectual assets like its app and brand, while companies like Amazon rely heavily on physical assets like warehouses. 
	
	The ongoing success of a firm may depend heavily on a few key assets, as shown by Zynga’s reliance on an agreement with Facebook, which once supported its business model but weakened after it ended.

- #### 3. Financials
	- The third component of a business model is **financials**, which outlines how a firm earns money. It includes **revenue streams**, **cost structure**, and **financing/funding**.

	1. **Revenue Streams**: These describe how a business generates income. Companies may have one or multiple revenue streams, such as product sales, subscriptions, or services. For example, Birchbox has two revenue streams: a subscription service and an online store. Businesses can earn money through one-time payments or recurring revenue (e.g., subscriptions). The number and nature of revenue streams impact other elements of the business model.
	
	2. **Cost Structure**: This identifies the key costs needed to support a firm’s business model. It determines if the business is ==**cost-driven**== (focused on minimizing costs, like Warby Parker) or ==**value-driven** ==(focused on offering high-quality products or services). Costs can be **fixed** (e.g., app development) or **variable** (e.g., labor for a sandwich shop). It's important to outline ==major cost categories==, such as Facebook's data centers, marketing, and R&D.
	- Generally, the goal for this box in a firm’s business model template is threefold: identify whether the business is a cost- driven or value-driven business, identify the nature of the business’s costs, and identify the business’s major cost categories.
	- Fixed costs are costs that remain the same despite the volume of goods or services provided. Variable costs vary proportionally with the volume of goods or services pro- duced.
	
	3. **Financing/Funding**: Many businesses need ==initial capital== to launch before generating revenue. This includes **capital costs** (e.g., real estate, equipment), **one-time expenses** (e.g., legal fees, website development), and **ramp-up expenses** (cash needed to cover operations until profitability). The business model should estimate how much funding is required and where it will come from. 
	
	Overall, financials are critical in determining how a business sustains itself and grows.

- #### Operations
	- The **operations** section of a business model focuses on how a firm produces its products or services, delivers them to customers, and relies on key partners. The primary elements of operations are:
	
	1. **Product (or Service) Production**: This describes how a firm’s products or services are produced. For physical products, production can be done in-house, through contract manufacturing, or by outsourcing. For services, a brief but substantive explanation of how the service will be delivered should be provided. For instance, Rover.com connects dog owners with sitters through a website, with quality assurance and customer support.
	
	2. **Channels**: Channels explain how a ==firm delivers its product or service to customers==, whether directly (e.g., through a storefront or website), through intermediaries (e.g., distributors like Amazon), or via a combination. The choice of channel affects other business aspects. For instance, Warby Parker sells directly, whereas GoPro uses intermediaries and distributors to widen its product reach.
	
	3. **Key Partners**: Partnerships are essential for many businesses, especially start-ups, as they may lack resources or expertise. The most common partners are **suppliers**, who provide parts or services critical to the business. Companies also partner through **strategic alliances**, **joint ventures**, or by utilizing **freelancers** for tasks outside their core competencies. ==Partnerships help businesses gain access to resources, share risks and costs, and accelerate time-to-market.== However, they ==also pose risks such as loss of proprietary information and management complexities.==
	
	These elements define the day-to-day activities that make a firm’s business model operational and sustainable.
