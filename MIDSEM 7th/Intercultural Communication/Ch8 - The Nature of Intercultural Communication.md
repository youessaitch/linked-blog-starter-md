- Communication is an element of culture.
- Whereas communication is a process, culture is the structure through which the communication is formulated and interpreted.
### Acculturation
- **Acculturation is the process of  adjusting and ==adopting to a new and different culture==**
- People do not want to abandon their past; therefore they acculturate new ideas into their exiting culture.
- #### Cultural Synergy
	- Cultural synergy occurs when people from different cultures blend and integrate significant elements of each other's cultural differences, leading to the creation of a new, stronger, and unified culture.
	- When two distinct cultures interact and absorb aspects of each other’s practices, they can develop a synergistic culture that combines the strengths and similarities of both. This merging can enhance the overall cultural experience and create a more dynamic and resilient cultural environment.
	- Example: Corporate - diff people from diff backgrounds work on same thing with their unique ability

### Ethnocentrism: 
- It is the view that one's own culture and its ways of thinking, values, and communication methods are correct, while ==other cultures are perceived as inferior, incorrect,== or less developed.
- According to Fischer (1997), ethnocentrism can be described as a mindset that influences how people understand and interact with different cultural perspectives. This mindset often results in biased judgments and misunderstandings about other cultures.

### Mindsets
- Mindsets are ways of being that allow us to see, perceive, and reason through our own cultural awareness. Mindsets are learned by growing up in a particular culture. We learn to be open or closed to others and their way of living; however, these mindsets can be altered.
- Mindsets include the psychological and cultural factors that make us individuals and make us different or similar.
- Every culture in the world has a different mindset, and every individual within that culture has a variance to that mindset

### Cultural Intelligence
- **Cultural Intelligence (CQ)** is the capability to effectively navigate and engage with people from different cultural backgrounds.
- It includes:
	1. linguistic intelligence
	2. spatial intelligence: - The ability to perceive and understand spatial relationships and environments within different cultural contexts.
	3. intra and interpersonal intelligence


### Intercultural Contructs (7)
Borden (1991) identifies seven key constructs for successful intercultural communication:

1. **Intent Awareness**: Recognize that communication may lead to either expressive behavior or information gathering, depending on your role.
   
2. **Independent Self-Concept**: Understand that your self-concept can vary between different cultures without being constrained by one cultural framework.

3. **Adaptability**: Work effectively within the personal, situational, and cultural constraints of communication systems in different cultures.

4. **Cultural Literacy**: Be knowledgeable about the customs, values, and norms of both your own culture and others.

5. **Language Competence**: Acquire proficiency in the languages of the cultures you interact with.

6. **Value Dimensions**: Understand how your culture and others rank on universal value dimensions and how these interact with cultural orientation models.

7. **Cultural Orientation**: Be aware of your culture’s and other cultures’ positions on associative-obstractive, particularistic-universalistic, and close-minded/open-minded dimensions, and use this knowledge to understand communicative styles.
