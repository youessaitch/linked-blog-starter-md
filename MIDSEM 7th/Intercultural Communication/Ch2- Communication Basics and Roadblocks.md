- The document outlines several common communication roadblocks that can hinder effective interaction between people. Here are the main roadblocks:

1. **Differences in Perspective**:
   - People have different socio-cultural backgrounds, life experiences, personalities, and values. These differences can create barriers in understanding one another clearly.

2. **Differences in Knowledge Levels**:
   - A gap in expertise or familiarity with a topic can make communication difficult, especially between professionals and non-professionals within an organization.

3. **Lack of Common Language**:
   - Using ==jargon, acronyms, or technical language== unfamiliar to the other party can lead to confusion and hinder clear communication.

4. **Stereotyping and Jumping to Conclusions**:
   - Making assumptions about others or categorizing them based on limited information can block true understanding.

5. **Strong Emotions**:
   - Intense emotions such as love, hate, anger, or jealousy can distort messages, making it hard to communicate rationally or clearly.

6. **Self-Centeredness**:
   - People often focus on their own viewpoints and fail to consider the perspective of others. This egocentrism can weaken the ability to communicate effectively.

7. **Laziness**:
   - Communication is hard work, and laziness can lead to inadequate preparation or lack of effort in listening and conveying messages properly【8†source】.

These roadblocks can be overcome by adopting practices such as understanding others' perspectives, offering and seeking feedback, choosing appropriate communication channels, and actively listening.
