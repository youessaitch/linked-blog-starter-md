- 3-tier
- # Tier-1
	- In 1-Tier Architecture the database is directly available to the user, the user can directly sit on the DBMS and use it that is, the client, server, and Database are all present on the same machine
	- Example: SQL 
- # Tier-2
	- The 2-tier architecture is similar to a basic [client-server model](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/client-server-model/). The application at the client end directly communicates with the database on the server side. APIs like ODBC and JDBC are used for this interaction.
	- The application on the client side establishes a connection with the server side to communicate with the DBMS.
	- An advantage of this type is that maintenance and understanding are easier, and compatible with existing systems. ==However, this model gives poor performance when there are a large number of users.==
	- Scalable
- # Tier-3
	- In [3-Tier Architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-3-tier-architecture-in-dbms-set-2/), there is another layer between the client and the server. The client does not directly communicate with the server. Instead, it interacts with an application server which further communicates with the database system and then the query processing and transaction management takes place.
	- This intermediate layer acts as a medium for the exchange of partially processed data between the server and the client.
	- This type of architecture is used in the case of large web applications.

	- ### ****Advantages of 3-Tier Architecture****
	
	- ****Enhanced scalability:**** Scalability is enhanced due to the distributed deployment of application servers. Now, individual connections need not be made between the client and server.
	- ****Data Integrity:**** 3-Tier Architecture maintains Data Integrity. Since there is a middle layer between the client and the server, data corruption can be avoided/removed.
	- ****Security:**** 3-Tier Architecture Improves Security. This type of model prevents direct interaction of the client with the server thereby reducing access to unauthorized data.
	
	### ****Disadvantages of 3-Tier Architecture****
	
	- ****More Complex:**** 3-Tier Architecture is more complex in comparison to 2-Tier Architecture. Communication Points are also doubled in 3-Tier Architecture.
	- ****Difficult to Interact:**** It becomes difficult for this sort of interaction to take place due to the presence of middle layers.
