### Friday
- didnt do much, all day went to managing partition on pc to increase disk size on ubuntu and to set up Syncthing, making this file to check how's it working.
- Restarted my pc, checking again how is this working.
- Restarted again by setting it as a service, lets check again.
- Now, its working. Cool, just added it to start at boot.
